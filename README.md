# CV

## Summary
I hold a PhD in Computer Science, specialized in Machine Learning. My expertise spans several areas: large-scale multimodal language models applied to video and document analysis, generative diffusion models for image and video creation, trajectory reconstruction (Time Series), information extraction (Named Entities), and language modeling. I completed my PhD within the team APP (Learning) at the LITIS laboratory (Laboratory of Computer Science, Information Processing and Systems) at the University of Rouen Normandy, benefiting from a French government excellence scholarship via the French embassy in Yemen (2013-2016). After my doctorate, I continued at the University of Rouen as an ATER (Temporary Teaching and Research Assistant) in the RT department (Computer and Telecommunications Networks) of the IUT of Rouen - Elbeuf site (2017-2018), then as a post-doctoral researcher within the APP team of the LITIS laboratory (2018-2019). Subsequently, I participated as a post-doctoral researcher in the research project "Kaligo-based Intelligent Handwriting Teacher" (KIHT) within the Intuidoc (Intuitive User Interaction for Document) team at the IRISA laboratory (Institute for Research in Computer Science and Random Systems) in Rennes. This research was conducted in collaboration with French (Learn & Go) and German (STABILO) industrial partners.

Currently, I am a principal researcher in multimodal artificial intelligence and computer vision in the VQA (Visual Question Answering) team of the EI and Cloud Services department at the Huawei Research and Technology Center in Finland. I led the DQA (Document Question Answering) research team of 4 multinational members. Following a strategic reorientation, the DQA team was dissolved to focus on topics related to visual question answering (VQA) and image and video generation.

Previously, I was a contractual associate professor in the computer science department of CY Cergy Paris Université. I was a member of the MIDI (Multimedia and Data Integration) team of the ETIS laboratory (Information Processing and Systems Teams) - UMR 8051 (CY Cergy Paris Université, ENSEA, CNRS).

My academic career is enriched by experience in higher education, acquired at the University of Rouen and the University of Sanaa (Yemen) as a teacher. In addition, I acquired 5 years of professional experience in telecommunications, successively holding the positions of advisor, technician, and technical director at Al-Saeedah, a satellite television channel in Yemen.
